# Dom-Array-Method

Here we'll be learning about array methods and manipulation of data of fetched API.

## Project Detail
- fetch random users from the [randommuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API.
- We'll use the forEach method of an array to loop through and output user/wealth.
- We'll use the map method of an array to filter only millionaires.
- We'll use the sort method of an array to sort by wealth.
- We'll use the reduce() method of an array to add all wealth.
